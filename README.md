# Cli-Calculator
first we create a class named as calculator 
then we defined basic operations following :
                                              - Addition  
                                              - Subtraction  
                                              - Multiplication  
                                              - Division (with zero-division handling)  
                                              - Exponentiation (power)
then we define main() function outside the class calculator
created an instance called cal=calculator()
following instance , created menu for operations including exit option ( with the message ) using while true loop 
now using try for exception handling 
then using if statements :
                          i . choice is not in range we print invalid input and we give continue for continuing the statement
                          ii. choice is last one (in menu it is exit option) then giving an thank u message and give break for breaking the statement
now we give two inputs which the code takes them dynamically
using ifelif statement we write choices and write operation for each one 
finally we call the main function
